    <p>My name is Tiffany Sandoval, I'm a studnt at cultivating coders class.
  I would to take this time to talk a little about me. First of all I'm a single
  parent, although it doesn't sound scary when I say in my head. sometime's I
  still feel like that single girl who has so much ambustion in life.
</p>

  <p>Although, it's hard to image how hard it was to come this far in my event
  and the sirese of my life or should I say our lives.To make a long story short
I always wantded to own my own bakery,restruant, bascilly I just wanted to own
my own place and someone to grow with and have a family. Well most likely that
ended up the oppsite way in that order. So,what I'm try to say life is so
unpredicable.</p>

  <p>If I have a kid I'll surely tell them that him/her...but wait I already do
  have a child and I do tell her everyday. That it's truely a blessing everyday,
every moment that I spend with her and that I can't wait to spend the rest of my
life with her. My erra of a single girl is left behind for a while, and now I
start my new life chapter.</p>

  <p>And in so taking this class is actually help in way I could never imagion.
  Now I could help other companies with their websites and adverising but that
was my second dream to have my very own web desgin company. Meeting my classmates
was also one of amazing life exprience for me, because I like waking up every
morning having adult conversations with them. I guess you can say, they are my
coffee of the day.</p>

  <p>Well from our first web desgin that we started in our class was what
  are five thing's you could not live with out.Well here they are...</p>

  <p>5 things I can't live without.</p>

  <p>My daughter</p>
  <p>Coffee</p>
  <p>My family</p>
  <p>Cell Phone</p>
  <p>Optimus Prime</p>
